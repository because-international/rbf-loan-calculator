I need a calculator for Revenue Based Finance (RBF).  I want to be able to enter different inputs/variables and see other variables automatically adjust.

Variables:

* Loan Repayment Cap  (aka Factor Rate). Example is 1.5x
* Loan Principle. Example is $5000 USD.
* Loan Amount including Factor Rate. Example is $7500 USD.
* Cost of Capital (Loan Principle x Factor Rate). Example is $2500 USD.
* Loan Revenue Share Rate. Example is 5%.
* Loan Repayment Period (in months). Example is 24 months.
* Company Annualized Profit Margin. Example is 16%.
* Company Annualized Revenue. Example is $22000 USD.

Note: These examples do not add up properly.

The goal is to take these variables, decide which one we are solving for, and input the rest. Each time we change what we are solving for, the variable values are remembered, but everything except the one we're solving for is editable.

For example, if we want to know how long we expect a loan to take to repay, we'd still request the rest of the variables, but we'd calculate the repayment amount in months ($7500 / (($22000 x .05) / 12)) = 82 months (6.8 years).  If that repayment period is not satisfactory for the loan, we might adjust, keeping all the inputs, but solve for Factor Rate by modifying the Repayment Period. In that case, perhaps we wanted a 48 month repayment period. Changing this input would allow the Factor Rate to be recalculated based on the forced Repayment Period.
